# Roki
Roki bundles your [ROFL] code and [wren] code into a functional
software, powered by [Raylib].

In a sense, [ROFL] is like HTML and CSS that defines the structure of your
software UI while [wren] deals with behaviour like Javascript for browser.

### Dependency
- [compiledb](https://pypi.org/project/compiledb/) - for generating
  `compile_commands.json`
- [raylib's dependency](https://www.raylib.com/)

[wren]: https://github.com/wren-lang/wren
[ROFL]: https://github.com/RechieKho/rofl
[Raylib]: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib
